    <br>
    <p class="left-align">Data collection is defined as the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in an established systematic fashion that enables one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses, and evaluate outcomes.</p>
    <p class="left-align">By that definition data collection does not stop when the data has been collected. </p>
    <p class="left-align">There is real power in making data digestable to the general public. We are collecting more data than ever, but what are we doing with that data?</p>
    <p class="left-align">This project aims to make data from the Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Vera Institute easier to understand through visualization.</p>
    <p>I find it important to shed light on the numbers of those incarcerated in the United States. We have one of the largest incarcerated populations in the world. The project aims to get people thinking and talking about mass incarceration and the large number of incarcerated persons in the U.S.</p>
